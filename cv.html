        <font size="5" style="color:rgba(71, 78, 163, 0.98)"> Hi, I'm Welmoed, a medical biologist in Berlin.</font> As a freshly started PhD student at the Charité Institute of Tropical Medicine in Berlin, I spend my time investigating the link between resistance development in malaria parasites and hemoglobinopathies in humans. That involves cell culture, molecular biology and epidemiology.

        During my MSc programme Tropical and Infectious Diseases at the University of Antwerp I develloped a strong interest in parasitology, epidemiology, immunology and wherever that touches maths and stats.

        The use of transmission models for public health and epidemiology fascinates me and I like playing around with epidemiological data. Actually, I like playing with data in general.

        After my MSc graduation, I started a job as research assistant at the Infectious Disease Control Group, Department of Public Health, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam. I was involved in small tasks for the ongoing projects about Onchocerciasis and soil transmitted helminths (STHs) and investigated a new approach to simulate empirical field data of Onchocerciasis transmission. Besides getting acquainted with helminth infections and with this type of modelling, I got very skilled in R programming!

        For my master dissertation at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit The Gambia tuberculosis (TB) immunology team (in collaboration with the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) Antwerp), I carried out stimulation assays on whole blood with TB antigens to find out whether the measured immune response could improve TB diagnosis in Gambian children.

        During a short internship at the Oxford University Department of Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Diseases I got acquainted with mathematical modelling in Matlab. I made simplified models for population dynamics with different host immunity features and pathogen strain structures.
