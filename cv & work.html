      </p>
          
      <p>
        As a freshly started PhD student at the Charit√© Institute of Tropical Medicine in Berlin, I spend my time investigating the link between resistance development in malaria parasites and hemoglobinopathies in humans. That involves cell culture, molecular biology and epidemiology.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        During my MSc programme Tropical and Infectious Diseases at the University of Antwerp I develloped a strong interest in parasitology, epidemiology, immunology and wherever that touches maths and stats. 
      </p>
          
      <p>
        The use of transmission models for public health and epidemiology fascinates me and I like playing around with epidemiological data. Actually, I like playing with data in general. 
      </p>

      <strong>Experience:</strong>
          
      <p>
        After my MSc graduation, I started a job as research assistant at the Infectious Disease Control Group, Department of Public Health, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam. I was involved in small tasks for the ongoing projects about Onchocerciasis and soil transmitted helminths (STHs) and investigated a new approach to simulate empirical field data of Onchocerciasis transmission. Besides getting acquainted with helminth infections and with this type of modelling, I got very skilled in R programming!
      </p>   
          
      <p>
        For my master dissertation at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit The Gambia tuberculosis (TB) immunology team (in collaboration with the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) Antwerp), I carried out stimulation assays on whole blood with TB antigens to find out whether the measured immune response could improve TB diagnosis in Gambian children.
      </p>
          
      <p>
        During a short internship at the Oxford University Department of Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Diseases I got acquainted with mathematical modelling in Matlab. I made simplified models for population dynamics with different host immunity features and pathogen strain structures.
