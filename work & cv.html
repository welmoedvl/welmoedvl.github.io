        <h2> Hi, I'm Welmoed, a medical biologist in Berlin.</h2> 

        <p>
          As a PhD student at the Charit√© Institute of Tropical Medicine in Berlin, I spend my time investigating the link between resistance development in malaria parasites and hemoglobinopathies in humans. That involves cell culture, molecular biology and epidemiology.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my MSc programme Tropical and Infectious Diseases at the University of Antwerp I develloped a strong interest in parasitology, immunology, epidemiology and wherever that touches maths and stats. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The use of transmission models for public health and epidemiology fascinates me and I like playing around with epidemiological data. I hope to make infectious disease control my core bussiness in future.

        <h3>Experience</h3>

        <p>
          After my MSc graduation, I started a job as research assistant at the Infectious Disease Control Group of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. I was involved in small tasks for the ongoing projects about Onchocerciasis and soil transmitted helminths (STHs) and investigated a new approach to improve simulations of empirical Onchocerciasis transmission data. Besides getting acquainted with helminth epidemiology and with individual based modelling, I enriched my R programming skills.
        </p>   

        <p>
          For my master dissertation, I studied the in vitro immune responses to tuberculosis (TB) antigens to improve TB diagnosis in Gambian children. I practiced at the Immunology lab of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Antwerp and carried out the actual project at the TB immunology group of the Medical Research Council (MRC) in The Gambia. Here, I learned to do stimulation assays and to carry out, optimize and analyze flow cytometric assays. But more importantly, I acquired experience in collaborating with a clinical field team and lab team.
        </p>

        <p>
          During a short internship at the Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Diseases Department of the Oxford University, I got familiar with mathematical modelling in Matlab. I made simplified models of population dynamics with different host immunity features and pathogen strain structures.
